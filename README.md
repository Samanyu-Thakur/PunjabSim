Title: PunjabSim: An Agri-Economic Digital Twin ðŸŒ¾

The Pitch: The agricultural economy of Punjab is a system of near-infinite complexity, with countless interconnected variables: weather patterns, water tables, crop prices, government policies, and supply chains. Create a simplified "Digital Twin" of this ecosystemâ€”a simulation that allows users to test the impact of major decisions.

The AI/ML Task:

    Core Task (Predictive Modeling & Simulation): Build several small, interconnected ML models:

        A weather forecaster (using time-series data).

        A crop yield predictor (based on weather, soil type, and water).

        A market price model (based on yield and historical demand).

    The "Infinite" Feature: The innovation is linking these models in a dashboard. A user could tweak a variableâ€”for example, "simulate a 15% decrease in monsoon rainfall"â€”and the model would run a simulation to show the cascading effects on yield and prices. This is a glimpse into modeling an infinitely complex real-worldÂ system.
